Building and running a container

## Step 1:
This folder contains a bash script that echoes out an environment variable called “HELLO” to standard out. 

In order to use this script, we would need to make the script executable by running the following command: 

```
chmod +x hello.sh
```

This will allow us to run the script by typing `./hello.sh` in the terminal / command prompt.
